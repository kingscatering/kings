			<h3 align="justify">Our Humble Beginning</h3>
			<p align="justify">King Philippe's Catering Service got the official business name when our Lord Almighty blessed us our first born, Kent Philippe. Two years ago when the family is celebrating Kent Philippe's Christening at the newly built Villa Marciana Resort, a Private Pool owned & operated by the Lagasca Family and almost everyone who are present on the occasion have the same thing in mind that "why not try the catering business"? yes, why not? We have been doing this some years back from relative, close family friends, etc. The next day, surprisingly, personal and phone inquiries started pouring in, one, two, three and so on and so on... That inspire us all to accept 50 pax, 100 pax, 200 pax... and came Baptismal Birthdays, Debuts, Weddings, Company Outing, Team Building Retreats, Company Christmas Party, and all other occasion.</p>
